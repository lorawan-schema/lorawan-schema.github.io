LoRaWAN Schema Definitions are data models and APIs used in the LoRaWAN ecosystem.

The aim of this project is to help LoRaWAN developers build interoperable solutions using schemas. The schemas are based on [JSON Schema][json-schema] and [OpenAPI][open-api] so they are usable across many different languages and frameworks. The schemas implement some [LoRaWAN specifications and recommendations][lorawan-specifications] governed by the [LoRa Alliance][lora-alliance].

The schema definitions are [Apache 2.0][license] licensed and are publicly available on [GitHub][gh-lorawan-schema]. This is a community project that is not affiliated with the LoRa Alliance.
