Welcome to the LoRaWAN Schema Definitions project page!

LoRaWAN Schema Definitions are data models and APIs used in the LoRaWAN ecosystem.

The aim of this project is to help LoRaWAN developers build interoperable solutions using schemas. The schemas are based on [JSON Schema][json-schema] and [OpenAPI][open-api] so they are usable across many different languages and frameworks.
